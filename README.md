# CUB3D



#     WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

textures

walking forward using "W" in the look direction not true North

smoother edges along the walls



#     KNOWN ISSUES
hitting wall creates floating point exception (or walking too long?)

actually, turning while next to a wall crashes with floating point

edges are not correct, too staircase like
