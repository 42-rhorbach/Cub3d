The RayCasting is separated in some steps to organize the implementation of the logic. See below to understand what each step does:

    Define a ray angle in relation of player FOV
    Create a ray loop. This loop will iterate the screen width
    Get the sin and cos of the ray angle to discover the numbers to increment to follow forward with the ray
    Create a loop to check if the position of the ray is an wall. If the position is not a wall, increment with sin and cos values and check again
    After find a wall, get the distance between player coordinates and ray coordinates with pythagoras theorem
    Discover the wall height reversing the got distance in relation of the half height of the screen using divide operator
    draw the "ceiling" line from the top of the screen to the top of the wall height
    draw the "wall" line in relation of the wall height obtained
    draw the "floor" line from the bottom of the wall height to the bottom of the screen
    Repeat this process for every ray (x-axis screen coordinate)

So, basically, we will draw just lines!

the direction given at the start.
N = 90
W = 180
S = 270
E = 0/360.

our field of view = 60, so direction - 30 and direction + 30.
we could (maybe) implement that turning head is per 1 degree angle.

get field of view and angle. 
fov needs to be in radius
